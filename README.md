## Project Objective 
#### Provide insight into grocery sales at Instacart to help develop a marketing strategy that targets customers with advertisements to appropriate products based on the customer profiles. 

## Key Business Questions and Goals
1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e. the days and times with the most order)?
2. Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money? 
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts. 
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
5. Customer Profiles 
   * What's the distribution among users regarding their brand loyalty (i.e. how often do they return to Instacart)?
   * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status? 
   * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region? 
   * Is there a connection between age and family status int erms of ordering habits? 
   * What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? 
   * What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? 
   
## Project Deliverables 
Multiple tasks were completed that covered a variety of Python concepts. The concepts covered included navigating Jupyter notebooks, importing libraries and data sets, consistency checks (duplicates, missing values), wrangling data (changing data types, dropping/renaming columns), deriving new columns, and creating visualizations. The final project deliverable was an Excel workbook that detailed all data exploration, visualizations, and recommendations.
